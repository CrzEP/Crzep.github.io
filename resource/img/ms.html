No reason - bad people

No one can wait
Unconsciously letting go of you
We don't have the courage to do that
Baby I'm sorry I'm so lonely 
My love keeps falling
Like a shooting star slowly being destroyed
As long as we let go of the sadness
Who else could it be defeated by
How can I be attracted to you
Find a reason for you to move towards me
I want to talk to you every day
Bring warmth into you
I dare not take my rough nerves lightly
Imagine traveling with you through every interstellar space
Accompany you through every miracle
I want to have a future with you
I don't want to be separated from you anymore
If you want to love happily
Then take advantage of this moment
My mind
It's all your dialogue
Put love outside the window
Waiting for us to love each other
Other irreplaceable
Treat you as a cloud
Absolutely won't sway
No one can wait
Unconsciously letting go of you
We don't have the courage to do that
Baby I'm sorry I'm so lonely 
My love keeps falling
Like a shooting star slowly being destroyed
As long as we let go of the sadness
Who else could it be defeated by
How can I be attracted to you
Find a reason for you to move towards me
I want to talk to you every day
Bring warmth into you
I dare not take my rough nerves lightly
Imagine traveling with you through every interstellar space
Accompany you through every miracle
I want to have a future with you
I don't want to be separated from you anymore
If you want to love happily
Then take advantage of this moment
My mind
It's all your dialogue
Put love outside the window
Waiting for us to love each other
Other irreplaceable
Treat you as a cloud
Absolutely won't sway
No one can wait
Unconsciously letting go of you
We don't have the courage to do that
Baby I'm sorry I'm so lonely 
My love keeps falling
Like a shooting star slowly being destroyed
As long as we let go of the sadness
Who else could it be defeated by
